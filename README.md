# Shitgrid

Definitely not Kitsu!

## Components

### Website

The website is designed to imitate Shotgrid, with basic abilities to create and view tasks and assets.

When an asset is added via the frontend, the backend creates a folder on disk within the `wip` folder.

The folders are used by the Blender addon as described below.

### Blender Addon

The Blender addon is responsible for publishing, version control and building.

Once a `wip` asset folder is added via the website, the addon can publish Blender files into that folder.

The build scripts take `wip` files and consolidate them into single assets, located in the `build` folder.

## Architecture

### Website Backend

The backend is written in JavaScript using Express.

It doesn't use a database for now, just basic file storage in `assets.json` and `tasks.json`.
