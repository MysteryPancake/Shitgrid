# Shitgrid

Definitely not Kitsu

## Components

### Website

The website is designed to imitate Shotgrid, with basic abilities to create and view tasks and assets.
It uses a React frontend and an Express backend, both which have to be run separately.
When an asset is added via the frontend, the backend creates a folder on disk.
These folders are used by the Blender addon as described below.

### Blender Addon

The Blender addon is responsible for managing asset versions.
Assets get published into the folders created by the website.

## Environment Variables

### Website

- Set `SHITGRID_WEB_DB` to a folder where you want the backend database to be stored, for example `C:/web_db`.
- Set `REACT_APP_SHITGRID_SERVER` to the URL of the web server backend, for example `http://localhost`.
- Set `REACT_APP_SHITGRID_PORT` to the web server backend port, for example `5000`.

### Blender Addon

- Set `SHITGRID_BLEND_DB` to a folder where you want Blender files to be stored, for example `C:/blender_db`.
